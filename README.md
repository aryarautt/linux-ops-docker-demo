\# 🚀 Linux Ops Docker Demo



This project demonstrates how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, run Linux commands inside a Docker container, and push the final image to DockerHub.  

It also includes key DevOps concepts and all the commands used during the assignment.

\## 📌 1. Five DevOps Concepts (Simple \& Clear)



\### \*\*1️⃣ Continuous Integration (CI)\*\*

The practice of automatically building and testing code every time a change is made. This helps detect issues early.



\### \*\*2️⃣ Continuous Delivery (CD)\*\*

Ensures that software is always in a release-ready state. After code passes tests, it can be deployed anytime.



\### \*\*3️⃣ Containerization\*\*

Packaging applications with all their dependencies into isolated containers (like Docker). This ensures consistent results across all environments.



\### \*\*4️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\*\*

Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code files instead of manual processes. Tools: Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible.



\### \*\*5️⃣ Version Control (Git)\*\*

Tracking every change in a project, enabling collaboration, rollback, and proper documentation using Git and GitHub.
